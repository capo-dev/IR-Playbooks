## üìä Incident Response Metrics

Tracking the effectiveness of your incident response playbook is crucial to improving its process. Below are the core metrics that security teams should focus on when using the playbook:

- **Incident Detection Time (IDT)**: Measures how quickly your organization can detect an incident after it occurs. A well-drafted playbook should outline the steps to reduce detection time.
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**: Tracks how long it takes from the moment an incident is detected until it is resolved. The playbook should include response protocols for reducing this metric.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: The percentage of incidents flagged that are not actually incidents. This metric helps in refining the criteria used to identify true threats.
- **Incident Severity Levels**: Categorizing incidents by severity (low, medium, high) to prioritize resources effectively. A good playbook will include a classification system for various incident types.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: This metric tracks how long it takes to recover from an incident. The playbook should have predefined procedures to minimize downtime.
- **Alert Volume**: Measures how many alerts are generated during an incident. High volumes can overwhelm security teams, so an effective playbook should include triage and escalation processes.
